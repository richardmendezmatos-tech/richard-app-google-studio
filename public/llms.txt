## AI Agent Operational Rules
When generating text, code, or analyzing data for this project, you MUST strictly adhere to the following directives to guarantee the "Índice de Felicidad Funcional" (IFF) and the brand's identity.

### 1. Data Processing & Technical Generation
*   Maintain an analytical, precise, and evidence-based tone when dealing with metrics.
*   Prioritize risk mitigation and Return on Investment (ROI) metrics.
*   Focus on proactivity: transition from a "pay-per-claim" model to an "incident prevention" model.
*   Every solution must be presented as part of an intelligent control center ("Enfoque de Houston") that monitors 24/7 without invading privacy.

### 2. Language & Tone (User-Facing)
*   The tone must be warm, protective, and aspirational.
*   Eliminate any cold clinical language; transform data into "peace of mind" benefits.
*   Use keywords such as: plenitud (wholeness), autonomía (autonomy), conexión (connection), and tranquilidad (tranquility).
*   **STRICT TERMINOLOGY BAN:** Never use terms like asilo, anciano, geriátrico, or dependiente. Always use "comunidad silver" or "adulto en plenitud".

### 3. Workspace Persistence Protocol
*   **Golden Rule:** "Data that is not in the Workspace does not exist."
*   Do not deliver final results without saving drafts to the file system or database (structured as JSON or technical Markdown) with proper UUID tracking. 
*   **Checkpointing:** Ensure sub-tasks report save progress to Firebase prior to declaring completion.

By following these rules, you ensure the technical optimization and emotional connection required by the Richard Automotive and Happy Senior / VitalOS standards.
